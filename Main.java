//In Java, an object is created from a class
// Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. --  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter. 
//System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

// However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes
//You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method -- System.out.println(3 + 3);

// Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
//Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
