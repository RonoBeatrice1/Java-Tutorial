//Variables are containers for storing data values.

// In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

// String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
// int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
// float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
// char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
// boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

// Declaring (Creating) Variables -- To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value: type variableName = value;
// Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
